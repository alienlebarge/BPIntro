    <h1>Houses of Parliament in Canberra and Washington D.C.</h1>

    <p>The Australian capital, Canberra, has much in common with the capital of the USA, Washington
        <abbr title="District of Columbia">D.C.</abbr> In both cases, the location was agreed as a compromise
        between two opposing interests: Sydney and Melbourne in the Australian case, Maryland and Virginia
        in the American one. Perhaps this is part of why the two cities have such a similar feel? They are both
        artificial constructs, built on land that would quite likely otherwise be largely uninhabited by humans.</p>

    <p>The most obvious comparison to draw is the layout of the cities, focussed on a central avenue with
        key buildings at either end. In Washington, the Capitol is at one end of the National Mall: a broad, grassed
        boulevard that stretches in a straight line from Capitol Hill at one end to the Washington Memorial at the other
        (with the Lincoln Memorial and
        others between).</p>

    <p>In Canberra, a much longer boulevard stretches from Parliament House at the top of Capital Hill to
        the Australian War Memorial. Unlike Washington, the Australian War Memorial is itself on a hill (Mt. Ainslie)
        and the boulevard is interrupted by a lake (Lake Burley Griffin). Furthermore, the modern day Parliament House in
        Canberra is very young, having been built as recently as 1988 (work began on the American Capitol in the late 18th
        century).</p>

    <p>Canberra's Old Parliament building is closer to the lake but is exactly in line with the modern Parliament House and
        War Memorial.</p>

    <p>For many people from older countries, the idea of a planning to build a capital city from scratch, complete with
        boulevards stretching between important landmarks that are perfectly aligned with the compass, seems odd. Parliament
        buildings
        in places like London and Berlin are where they are because that's where the previous building was. And the one
        before that. And
        everything else will just jolly well have to fit around it! The German parliament building, the Reichstag, does have
        a
        boulevard stretching before it but Berlin does not have the same "obviously planned" layout as Canberra and
        Washington D.C.</p>
